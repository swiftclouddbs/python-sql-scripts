# python-sql-scripts
A client asked me to track the buyer demographics of sales of yoga mats at their national chain of sporting goods outlets.   The yogamat python scripts use the cx_Oracle module to query a cloud database and output files in csv format for use in spreadsheets or to be graphed.  These code snippets can be strung together to make dedicated applications.
